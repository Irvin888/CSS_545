1. Intended platform for final project: iOS
2. Intended framework/programming language for your final project: Swift
3. Whether you want to explore cross-platform development: No

A brief explanation for my selections:
  I chose iOS because I'm used to it and I want to explore how to build a project in this environment, which led to me pick Swift because of its convenience. 
  However, I do not want to do cross-platform development since I'm taking this course just to expand my horizon instead of aiming to get into the industry.
